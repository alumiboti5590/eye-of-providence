# Eye of Providence

This is a collection of reusable code pieces for the Alumiboti to use in their robot projects. The goal is to reduce the amount of code that needs to be created or copied year-over-year.

The Eye of Providence is frequently tied to the ~~Alumiboti~~ Illuminati, but it really is meant to represent a higher being watching over humanity. It is one of the more recognized symbols, and we feel as though this repository aims to "watch over" our code ensure it works as well as it can. Does this make any sense? No? Well, it's a neat symbol and sounds cool, so we are sticking with it.
